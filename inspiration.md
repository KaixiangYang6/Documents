But make no mistake: what makes today’s remote work platforms work reliably and well enough to make them useful indeed depend on advanced computing: cloud platforms to perform at massive scale, AI algorithms to smartly route traffic, robotic-enabled warehouses to feed us things through the internet, even some cute AI to give us virtual backgrounds to replace that messy spare room home office with beautiful skylines.  
但不要搞错了：使今天的远程工作平台能够可靠和良好地工作，使其有用的东西确实取决于先进的计算：云平台以大规模的方式执行，人工智能算法以智能路由交通，机器人启用的仓库通过互联网为我们提供东西，甚至一些可爱的人工智能给我们提供虚拟背景，用美丽的天际线取代那个混乱的空闲家庭办公室。

The robots themselves, like driverless cars, may still be a long time coming at the broadest scale. But the era of remote work, however it evolves, is an era of AI and robotic -enabled automation. The robots are already here, they just don’t look like we thought they would.
机器人本身，如无人驾驶汽车，在最广泛的范围内可能仍然是一个漫长的过程。但远程工作的时代，无论它如何演变，都是一个人工智能和机器人实现自动化的时代。机器人已经在这里了，只是它们看起来不像我们想象的那样.

Remote presence is itself a form of automation. We have yet to see autonomous cars and ubiquitous “lights out” factories with no workers. But every time we hold a Zoom call or a remote conference, we are employing telepresence as a form of automation. When we meet online, even as close colleagues, there is an assistant who does not prepare the coffee, a small caterer who does not bake rich muffins, an hourly worker who does not clean the conference room that evening. When we meet online across the country, we are not buying taxi- or Uber rides to get us to the airport. We are not dropping a few bucks to get a coffee from an airport vendor. We are not visiting hotels, not requiring our rooms to be cleaned, not eating in restaurants, not spending into a travel and hospitality industry that is a significant source of support for low- and middle-skilled workers. As always, the users often do not see the workers who are displaced from these tasks and jobs, but the human effects are real.
远程存在本身就是一种自动化的形式。我们还没有看到自动驾驶汽车和无处不在的没有工人的 "熄灯 "工厂。**但是，每当我们举行Zoom电话或远程会议时，我们都在使用远程呈现作为一种自动化形式。当我们在网上见面时，即使是亲密的同事，也有一个助理不准备咖啡，一个小餐饮店不烤制丰富的松饼，一个小时工不在当晚打扫会议室。当我们在全国各地的网上见面时，我们并没有购买出租车-或优步(Uber)来送我们到机场。我们不会砸下几块钱从机场小贩那里买一杯咖啡。我们没有去酒店，没有要求打扫房间，没有在餐馆吃饭，没有在旅游和酒店业消费，而这个行业是支持中低技能工人的一个重要来源。像往常一样，用户往往看不到那些从这些任务和工作中被淘汰的工人，但人类的影响是真实的。**

一切远程数字化，对传统的线下产业带来打击，线下产业需要思考新的吸引点，无可被线上、被虚拟化、数字化取代的特点与线上对抗。或者转型成服务于线上的形态，正所谓打不过就加入。



# Machine learning, explained

<https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained>

**Supervised** machine learning models are trained with labeled data sets, which allow the models to learn and grow more accurate over time. For example, an algorithm would be trained with pictures of dogs and other things, all labeled by humans, and the machine would learn ways to identify pictures of dogs on its own. Supervised machine learning is the most common type used today.

In **unsupervised** machine learning, a program looks for patterns in unlabeled data. Unsupervised machine learning can find patterns or trends that people aren’t explicitly looking for. For example, an unsupervised machine learning program could look through online sales data and identify different types of clients making purchases.

**Reinforcement** machine learning trains machines through trial and error to take the best action by establishing a reward system. Reinforcement learning can train models to play games or train autonomous vehicles to drive by telling the machine when it made the right decisions, which helps it learn over time what actions it should take.


**Natural language processing**

Natural language processing is a field of machine learning in which machines learn to understand natural language as spoken and written by humans, instead of the data and numbers normally used to program computers. This allows machines to recognize language, understand it, and respond to it, as well as create new text and translate between languages. Natural language processing enables familiar technology like chatbots and digital assistants like Siri or Alexa.

**Neural networks**

Neural networks are a commonly used, specific class of machine learning algorithms. Artificial neural networks are modeled on the human brain, in which thousands or millions of processing nodes are interconnected and organized into layers.

In an artificial neural network, cells, or nodes, are connected, with each cell processing inputs and producing an output that is sent to other neurons. Labeled data moves through the nodes, or cells, with each cell performing a different function. In a neural network trained to identify whether a picture contains a cat or not, the different nodes would assess the information and arrive at an output that indicates whether a picture features a cat.

**Deep learning**

Deep learning networks are neural networks with many layers. The layered network can process extensive amounts of data and determine the “weight” of each link in the network — for example, in an image recognition system, some layers of the neural network might detect individual features of a face, like eyes, nose, or mouth, while another layer would be able to tell whether those features appear in a way that indicates a face.  

Like neural networks, deep learning is modeled on the way the human brain works and powers many machine learning uses, like autonomous vehicles, chatbots, and medical diagnostics.

“The more layers you have, the more potential you have for doing complex things well,” Malone said.

Deep learning requires a great deal of computing power, which raises concerns about its economic and environmental sustainability.
